#### To those on OSX or Windows: Don't let a slow experience give you an impression that Docker isn't enterprise-grade!

1. Docker is amazing, fast, and flexible.
1. Prior tools, boot2docker particularly, were slow and prone to crash.

 Docker can currently run natively on a Linux Kernel v3.4+ - and the current boot2docker vm actually runs v4.

 Best use of your hardware: Install the Latest Debian or Ubuntu on your Mac/Windows box,

 ... c'mon those games aren't helping your code...

## Check your setup

Review the output of `docker info` command.

1. Security: Check the server for unexpectedly open ports (with `nmap` from a remote network)
1. DNS: Use a local cache or low-latency DNS server.
1. Storage: Use the correct storage driver (`overlay2` is likely)
